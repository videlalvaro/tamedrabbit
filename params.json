You also need to apply the `rabbit_management.diff` patch to the [rabbitmq-management repo](http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-management/)\r\n\r\nInside the downloads folder you can find the standalone release file\r\n[rabbitmq-server-osx-2.8.1u.tar.gz](https://raw.github.com/videlalvaro/rabbitmq-release/master/downloads/rabbitmq-server-osx-2.8.1u.tar.gz).\r\nFeel free to untar it and test it on your Mac.\r\n\r\nThe release has been built with `Erlang R15B01 (erts-5.9.1)` on a Mac with **OSX Lion**.\r\n\r\nRead the instructions located in the realted README file to see how to run the server.\r\n\r\n## Idea ##\r\n\r\nThe idea of generating that relase is to provide an easy to use RabbitMQ distribution that can\r\nbe used for development. By easy to use it means that you don't need to build/install Erlang to\r\nrun the server since a minimal Erlang distribuion is self contained there.\r\n\r\nAlso the rabbitmq-management plugin is pre installed so you have a friendly user interface\r\nthat you can use to interact with RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\n## Building it yourself ##\r\n\r\nBefore trying this make sure you have installed the required tools listed\r\n[here](http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html)\r\n\r\n    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella/\r\n    cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella\r\n    hg checkout 93ffc675897c\r\n    make co\r\n    cd rabbitmq\r\n    hg checkout 7df76eda4753\r\n    hg import --no-commit path/to/release.branch.diff\r\n    cd ..\r\n    make release VERSION=2.8.1u\r\n    cd rabbitmq-server\r\n    make plugins PLUGINS_SRC_DIR=\"..\" VERSION=2.8.1u\r\n    chmod +x pre-release/scripts/make_rel\r\n    make rlsdist VERSION=2.8.1u PLUGINS_SRC_DIR=..\r\n\r\nYour new release file will be inside:\r\n\r\n`rabbitmq-server/pre-release/build/rabbitmq-server-2.8.1u.tar.gz`\r\n\r\n# NOTE #\r\n\r\nThis release is unofficial and not supported by the RabbitMQ.
